# AI Mock Interviewer

AI Mock Interviewer is a web application designed to help users prepare for job interviews. Leveraging the power of Google's Gemini AI, it generates tailored interview questions based on job roles and descriptions, provides a realistic interview simulation experience, and delivers instant, AI-driven feedback on user responses.

## Features

*   **Dashboard & History:** A personal dashboard displays a summary of your interview activity, including total interviews, average scores, and recent sessions.
